# üõ°Ô∏è SecureBank: Penetration Testing & Threat Hunting

**Submitted by:** Judy Raj  
**Date:** March 27, 2025  
**Focus:** Vulnerability identification (IBM X-Force), Google Dorking analysis, penetration testing planning, and AES symmetric encryption for secure storage.

## Overview
This project demonstrates a complete vulnerability analysis and ethical penetration testing workflow for a simulated bank, SecureBank. Tasks include: identifying a recent CVE via IBM X-Force Exchange, investigating exposure with Google Dorking, designing a penetration testing plan, and securing sensitive credentials using AES symmetric encryption.
