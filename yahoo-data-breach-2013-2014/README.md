---

## 💡 Lessons Learned
- Adopt strong encryption (e.g., AES-256) and MFA.
- Maintain proactive threat monitoring and disclosure timelines.
- Embed cybersecurity into organizational culture.

---

## 🧭 Recommendations
1. Implement real-time breach detection systems.
2. Update encryption and password hashing standards.
3. Establish rapid incident response playbooks.
