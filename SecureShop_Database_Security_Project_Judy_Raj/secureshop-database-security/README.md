# 🧮 SecureShop Database Security and Management Project

**Course:** Coursera – Comprehensive Database Security and Management  
**Submitted by:** Judy Raj  
**Score:** 50 / 50 (Passed with Excellence)  
**Submission Date:** February 12, 2025  

This project demonstrates hands-on database security and management skills using MySQL. The SecureShop database includes tables for customers, orders, products, and payment details. Each task applies a different security or data management concept to simulate real-world database protection strategies.

## 🧩 Tasks and Deliverables

| **Task** | **Description** | **Points** |
|-----------|----------------|-------------|
| **Task 1 – Database Design and Implementation** | Import SecureShop database, explore tables (`customers`, `orders`, `products`, `payment_details`) and execute SQL queries. | 10 |
| **Task 2 – Data Protection Strategies** | Implement encryption, decryption, and masking to safeguard customer information. | 10 |
| **Task 3 – Database Security and User Management** | Create and manage a user role “Delivery Executive” with specific permissions on the `customers` table. | 10 |
| **Task 4 – Injection Vulnerabilities** | Identify SQL injection vulnerabilities and test safe query practices using parameterized queries. | 20 |

**Total:** 50 points
